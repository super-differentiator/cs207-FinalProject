    "Differentiation has been a major topic of calculus for a long time for its wide application in studies of almost all major science deciplines. It's especially often used in studying the behaviours of models and is also essential for solving optimization problems. Multiple ways have been developed to solve differential equations, through deriving an exact fomula or through estimating by numerical methods. Automatic differentiation is one important way that we use to solve differential problems. It utilizes the power of a computer to replace manual work and yield results with desired efficiency. Itâ€™s important because sometimes differentiation requires tedious calculations and is also likely to be inaccurate due to complexity of equations, and we want computers to solve these problems automatically for us. Thus, in this project, we will implement an automatic diffrentiator using forward mode to solve differentiation problems for users.\n"

    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain rule and graph structures will be the cornerstone underlying our program to differentiate various functions. The differentiation process of a complex function can be decomposed into calculating the derivatives of a chain of simple functions. The idea of computation graph will guide how the chain of derivatives will be evaluated and combined to reach the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chain Rule\n",
    "One important result in calculus that we use in differentiation is the chain rule, where we calculate the derivative of some function `f(x)` with respect to `x` as the product of the derivative of `f` with respect to some other variable that is also a function of `x` and the derivative of that function with respect to `x`. In mathematical formula, it's represented below:\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dx}f\\left[u(x)\\right] = f'\\left[u(x)\\right] \\cdot u'(x)$$\n",
    "or\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du} \\times \\frac{du}{dx}$$\n",
    "where `f`,`y`,`u` are functions of `x`.\n",
    "Chain rule also works in multidimentional case when we have a vector of variables. Then `f`,`y`,`u` will be vectors and their derivatives will be matrices. This derivaitve is called the Jacobian. The Jacobian for a function of two inputs and two outputs is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2, J = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "We then take the matrix product of the two calculated derivatives to get the final answer, which is again a vector. Chain rule underlies our automatic differentiation package as it allows us to break down equations to small parts of elementary functions for calculating derivative, and we then aggregate the final result using chain rule. A better exlaination of how we aggregate results will be explained under graph structure of calculation, and before that we would introduce what we mean by elemetary functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Elementary functions\n",
    "By elementary functions, we mean the functions that cannot be decomposed as aan appregation of some functions applied one by another. These functions include +, -, x, /, square root, logarithms and trigonometric functions. The functions input that we are going to deal with can be regarded as a combination of one or more such functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graph structure of Calculation\n",
    "Graph structure of calculate presents better visualization of how we use chain rule to break down complex functions to elememtary functions. Here we include a small example of the graph sturcture of a simple function: $f(x,y) = sin(x) + 2y$\n",
    "![graph_eg.png](attachment:graph_eg.png)\n",
    "##### This is an image showing the graphical structure of the given equation. The image cannot be loaded on github but can be seen when this file is open locally. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the sample function is broken into nodes, where each node applies one elementary function to the variable and the function is eventrually composed at the end of the process. Through navigating trhough these nodes, we can calculate the value and derivative at each step and record and update these values when moving forward. At the final node, we shall have the desired result. For vector functions, we can just break each vector into a sequence of functions and apply this method to each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automatic differentiation\n",
    "The introdution above shows one way of doing automatc differentiation, the forward mode, which we will implement in our package. Indeed, automatic differentiation is a collection of comptational methods to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function through breaking down the function to elementary operations.\n",
    "It is efficient since we evaluate the function value and its derivative in linear time, based on the complexity of the function, since the chain rule and the graph structure works from the inside with the most basic pieces out to the full complexity of the whole function. It is also precise as it evaluate to machine precision at each step of the process.\n"

We get the function value by referencing `v.val`, which returns a list of column vectors for the function value. Each element in the list refers to the list of inputs given by the `X` objects. Since we only passed one input, the output of `v.val` was a list of length 1. We reference the Jacobian by calling `v.jacobian()`, which returns the list of variables in the order they are in the Jacobian, and the list of Jacobian matrices evaluated at the inputs. We return the variables because there is no way to know what order the partial derivatives are in the matrix alone. Again, since we only passed one input to the `X` objects, the `jacs` list is length 1.

    "* What are the core data structures?\n",

    "For a scalar function of a single variable or many variables, we use two core data structures: lists and dictionaries, as well as a string to represent the name of the variable, like 'x', 'y', 'x_1', 'var1', or whatever the user desires. Since the user is able to evaluate the function for many inputs, we store the function output in a list, where the index corresponds to the index of the value given as input, which are also given as lists. We store the partial derivatives of a function as a dictionary, where the key corresponds to the name of the variable, which is either 'x' by default or given by the user, and the value is a list of floats, each corresponding to the partial derivative of the function with respect to the variable for the given input. A demonstration of this is given above in the How to use SuperDifferentiator $\\rightarrow$ Use Package section.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a vector function of many inputs and many outputs, we store each function in the vector as an `AD` object. As a result, it gets all of the same data structures used as above, which make it easy to get the function value and partial derivatives. The function value is given as a list of column vectors (using numpy), where each column vector in the list corresponds to the given input at that index. If the user just needs to evaluate the function for one value, then the list will be length one. The Jacobian function returns the list of variables in the order they appear in the Jacobian matrix, as well as a list of matrices (using numpy) which are the Jacobian evaluated at each of the given inputs. Since there is no implicit ordering of the variables given, as the user can give the variable names, we return the list of variables in the order that they appear in the Jacobian, to make it easy for the user to see which column corresponds to which variable. Again, if the user just needs to evaluate the Jacobian at one value, then this list will be length one. Again, demonstrations of this are given in the How to use SuperDifferentiator $\\rightarrow$ Use Package section.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What classes will you implement?\n",
    "\n",
    "The base class for all functionality is the `AD` class, located in the `AD.py` module. This class stores the function values and the partial derivatives at the points the user wants to evaluate. In this class we also implement all of the operator overloading by implementing the `__add__`, `__mul__`, `__sub__`, etc. methods. This allows us to easily interact AD objects to build the function we want the derivative of.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have classes for each elementary operation in the `functions.py` module: `X`, `Ln`, `Log`, `Exp`, etc. These all extend from the `AD` class so they can be interacted using python's build in operations. We decided to make these classes instead of functions that could return an AD object since it made more sense that these functions themselves would be AD objects, which have a function value and derivative. However, we could have implemented functions instead for these and the result would have been almost identical for the user. On the user's side, the difference would not be seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `X` class is where the user starts, passing in the value or values of $\\alpha$ that they want to evaluate the function value and derivative at, in the form of a single value or a list of values. From this, the user can build more complex functions, like polynomials using python operations +, -, \\*, /, and \\*\\*, or can build functions involving the elementary function. When you instantiate an object of one of the elementary functions, you pass in the function that you want this elementary function to take the value of (the `Log` class also takes the base of the log as the second argument). For example, if you build the function $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3$ and want to find the sin of this function at $\\alpha = 2$, you can do so as demonstrated below.\n",

    "**1. Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's method is a root-finding algorithm which continues to produce better approximations to the roots of a real-valued function, utilizing 1st order derivative. It uses the idea that a continuous and differentiable function can be approximated by a straight line tangent to it. Newton's method is not guaranteed to converge, but has high speed in converging to the actual root when the method does work. An 1D version of updating rule is shown here:\n",
    "$$ x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For each new x, it's calculated as the original x subtracted by its function value devided by its derivative. We need an initial guess for x to start as x0, and we stop when certain boudaries are reached, either when the maximum iteration is reached or when the function value is sufficiently close to 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Extended from the 1-D version, we also have a multidimentional version for Newton's method, where f is a list of functions and x would be a vector of values. The updating rule for multidimentional case is shown here.\n",
    "$$ X_{n+1} = X_{n} -J(X_n)^{-1}f(X_n)$$\n",
    "Here, the X_n terms are all vectors, and the $J(X_n)$ term is the Jacobean of function evaluated at $X_n$. The next X value is calculated as the original X subtracted by it function value devided by the matrix production of the inverse of the Jacobean matrix and the function, both evaluated at $X_n$.\n",

Max_iter is the maximum iteration the method will run. Verbose a a boolian value; by setting verbose to True, additional information about how the function runs and which values are generated for each iteration will be printed.\n",

The goal of gradient descent is to find the local minimum of a particular function. The algorithm of gradient descent is pretty straight forward.

To initialize a gradient descent calculator object, the users can specify the number of maximum iterations to to perform gradient descent, the desired level of precision, and the step size during each gradient update step. Currently, our module provides functions for users to perform gradient descent on functions of 1,2,3, or n variables.

Then, the user will initialize a gradient descent object with their desired parameter settings such as the number of iterations and step size. Next, the user can call the calculate gradient function by passing in the defined function and the initialized function variables.

    "We also discussed how we could better improve our project in the future. To start with, currently our implementation could only evaluate the value of the derivative of a function at a particular point. However, in some cases, it would be more interesting and practical for the user to see and use the symbolic form of the derivative of a function. We could add how to evaluate the derivative of a function in symbolic notations in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we could add more visualizations to our project to make it more useful from a research or educational perspective. It is true that there are already many packages out there for users to calculate the derivative of a function, but not many packages are also providing the capabilities to show users how the calculation is performed step by step. To illustrate, we could add automatically generated graphs to show the user how the forward mode is being applied step by step to evaluate the derivative of a complicated function. In the meantime, in the gradient descent module, we could add more visualizations to show how various step size could influence the performance gradient descent. This could make our project more useful for people who are learning these techniques.\n",

    "Lastly, with the capabilities provided by our automatic differentiation object, we are able to implement various gradient-based machine learning algorithms such as ridge regression, logistic regression, SVM, and neural networks. The major difference among these machine learning algorithms is that each of which has a different objective function or loss function. And the goal of training a machine learning model is to minimize this loss function by selecting a specific set of coefficients. Since we already have the ability to find the point where a function is at its minimum by using automatic differentiation, we are able to incorporate this capability to minimize the loss function of different machine learning algorithms. After we have established a general framework for training a model, for each gradient-based machine learning algorithm, we just need to pass into the framework this algorithm's objective function and initialize our automatic differentiation module to find the point at which the object function is at its minimum value. After that, we will have successfully implemented this machine learning algorithm.\n"
