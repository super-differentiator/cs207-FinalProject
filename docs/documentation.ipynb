    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiation has been a major topic of calculus for a long time for its wide application in studies of almost all major science deciplines. It's especially often used in studying the behaviours of models and is also essential for solving optimization problems. Multiple ways have been developed to solve differential equations, through deriving an exact fomula or through estimating by numerical methods. Automatic differentiation is one important way that we use to solve differential problems. It utilizes the power of a computer to replace manual work and yield results with desired efficiency. Itâ€™s important because sometimes differentiation requires tedious calculations and is also likely to be inaccurate due to complexity of equations, and we want computers to solve these problems automatically for us. Thus, in this project, we will implement an automatic diffrentiator using forward mode to solve differentiation problems for users.\n",

    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain rule and graph structures will be the cornerstone underlying our program to differentiate various functions. The differentiation process of a complex function can be decomposed into calculating the derivatives of a chain of simple functions. The idea of computation graph will guide how the chain of derivatives will be evaluated and combined to reach the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chain Rule\n",
    "One important result in calculus that we use in differentiation is the chain rule, where we calculate the derivative of some function `f(x)` with respect to `x` as the product of the derivative of `f` with respect to some other variable that is also a function of `x` and the derivative of that function with respect to `x`. In mathematical formula, it's represented below:\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dx}f\\left[u(x)\\right] = f'\\left[u(x)\\right] \\cdot u'(x)$$\n",
    "or\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du} \\times \\frac{du}{dx}$$\n",
    "where `f`,`y`,`u` are functions of `x`.\n",
    "Chain rule also works in multidimentional case when we have a vector of variables. Then `f`,`y`,`u` will be vectors and their derivatives will be matrices. This derivaitve is called the Jacobian. The Jacobian for a function of two inputs and two outputs is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2, J = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial y} \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial y}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "We then take the matrix product of the two calculated derivatives to get the final answer, which is again a vector. Chain rule underlies our automatic differentiation package as it allows us to break down equations to small parts of elementary functions for calculating derivative, and we then aggregate the final result using chain rule. A better exlaination of how we aggregate results will be explained under graph structure of calculation, and before that we would introduce what we mean by elemetary functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Elementary functions\n",
    "By elementary functions, we mean the functions that cannot be decomposed as aan appregation of some functions applied one by another. These functions include +, -, x, /, square root, logarithms and trigonometric functions. The functions input that we are going to deal with can be regarded as a combination of one or more such functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graph structure of Calculation\n",
    "Graph structure of calculate presents better visualization of how we use chain rule to break down complex functions to elememtary functions. Here we include a small example of the graph sturcture of a simple function: $f(x,y) = sin(x) + 2y$\n",
    "![graph_eg.png](attachment:graph_eg.png)\n",
    "##### This is an image showing the graphical structure of the given equation. The image cannot be loaded on github but can be seen when this file is open locally. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the sample function is broken into nodes, where each node applies one elementary function to the variable and the function is eventrually composed at the end of the process. Through navigating trhough these nodes, we can calculate the value and derivative at each step and record and update these values when moving forward. At the final node, we shall have the desired result. For vector functions, we can just break each vector into a sequence of functions and apply this method to each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automatic differentiation\n",
    "The introdution above shows one way of doing automatc differentiation, the forward mode, which we will implement in our package. Indeed, automatic differentiation is a collection of comptational methods to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function through breaking down the function to elementary operations.\n",
    "It is efficient since we evaluate the function value and its derivative in linear time, based on the complexity of the function, since the chain rule and the graph structure works from the inside with the most basic pieces out to the full complexity of the whole function. It is also precise as it evaluate to machine precision at each step of the process.\n",

We get the function value by referencing `v.val`, which returns a list of column vectors for the function value. Each element in the list refers to the list of inputs given by the `X` objects. Since we only passed one input, the output of `v.val` was a list of length 1. We reference the Jacobian by calling `v.jacobian()`, which returns the list of variables in the order they are in the Jacobian, and the list of Jacobian matrices evaluated at the inputs. We return the variables because there is no way to know what order the partial derivatives are in the matrix alone. Again, since we only passed one input to the `X` objects, the `jacs` list is length 1.

    "For a scalar function of a single variable or many variables, we use two core data structures: lists and dictionaries, as well as a string to represent the name of the variable, like 'x', 'y', 'x_1', 'var1', or whatever the user desires. Since the user is able to evaluate the function for many inputs, we store the function output in a list, where the index corresponds to the index of the value given as input, which are also given as lists. We store the partial derivatives of a function as a dictionary, where the key corresponds to the name of the variable, which is either 'x' by default or given by the user, and the value is a list of floats, each corresponding to the partial derivative of the function with respect to the variable for the given input. A demonstration of this is given above in the How to use SuperDifferentiator $\\rightarrow$ Use Package section.\n",

As a result, it gets all of the same data structures used as above, which make it easy to get the function value and partial derivatives. The function value is given as a list of column vectors (using numpy), where each column vector in the list corresponds to the given input at that index. If the user just needs to evaluate the function for one value, then the list will be length one. The Jacobian function returns the list of variables in the order they appear in the Jacobian matrix, as well as a list of matrices (using numpy) which are the Jacobian evaluated at each of the given inputs. Since there is no implicit ordering of the variables given, as the user can give the variable names, we return the list of variables in the order that they appear in the Jacobian, to make it easy for the user to see which column corresponds to which variable. Again, if the user just needs to evaluate the Jacobian at one value, then this list will be length one. Again, demonstrations of this are given in the How to use SuperDifferentiator $\\rightarrow$ Use Package section.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What classes will you implement?\n",
    "\n",
    "The base class for all functionality is the `AD` class, located in the `AD.py` module. This class stores the function values and the partial derivatives at the points the user wants to evaluate. In this class we also implement all of the operator overloading by implementing the `__add__`, `__mul__`, `__sub__`, etc. methods. This allows us to easily interact AD objects to build the function we want the derivative of.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have classes for each elementary operation in the `functions.py` module: `X`, `Ln`, `Log`, `Exp`, etc. These all extend from the `AD` class so they can be interacted using python's build in operations. We decided to make these classes instead of functions that could return an AD object since it made more sense that these functions themselves would be AD objects, which have a function value and derivative. However, we could have implemented functions instead for these and the result would have been almost identical for the user. On the user's side, the difference would not be seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `X` class is where the user starts, passing in the value or values of $\\alpha$ that they want to evaluate the function value and derivative at, in the form of a single value or a list of values. From this, the user can build more complex functions, like polynomials using python operations +, -, \\*, /, and \\*\\*, or can build functions involving the elementary function. When you instantiate an object of one of the elementary functions, you pass in the function that you want this elementary function to take the value of (the `Log` class also takes the base of the log as the second argument). For example, if you build the function $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3$ and want to find the sin of this function at $\\alpha = 2$, you can do so as demonstrated below.\n",

This allows the user to make full use of the python operators +, -, \\*, /, and \\*\\*. Since each elementary function class extends from `AD`, they get the full functionality as well.\n",
